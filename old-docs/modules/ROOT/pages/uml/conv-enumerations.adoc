==  Technical conventions on uml:Enumeration elements

In UML the controlled lists discussed in Section [xref:uml/conv-general.adoc#sec:controlled-lists[Controlled List]] are represented as uml:Enumeration. They are transformed into instances of a https://www.w3.org/TR/skos-reference/[SKOS model].

 *Title:* Interpretation of uml:Enumeration

|{set:cellbgcolor: #f5f8fc}
*Identifier:* rule:enumeration-to-skos

|*Statement:*

An uml:Enumeration element is transformed into `skos:ConceptScheme`, and an enumeration item into a `skos:Concept`.
|===

*Description:*


Each uml:Enumeration element is transformed into skos:ConceptScheme, and each enumeration item, if present as an uml:Attribute value, is transformed into a `skos:Concept`. An enumeration might be empty especially when it refers to an externally specified, controlled list.

//TODO We need in fact a flag that controlled whether the Enum definitions shall be present in the core layer (at all), or not.

In a uml:Enumeration element, the name shall be interpreted as the controlled list name; it must be a normalised string. Each attribute name is used as a local segment in the generation of the concept URI. The attribute type is ignored and is considered by default to be `skos:Concept`. The attribute alias is transformed into the `skos:Concept`s preferred label. The attribute initial value is transformed into the alternative label of the concept.
//TODO see if we need to specify additional rules for this.

Where no attribute alias is specified then the attribute name is used as the preferred label of the skos:Concept. This happens as skos:prefLabel is a mandatory property in the SKOS model.

It is possible to employ the enumerations for class properties by drawing a dependency (uml:Dependency) relation from the class to the enumeration and providing a relation target role. However, the enumeration should not connect to other elements.
