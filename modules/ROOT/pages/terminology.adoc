:doctitle: Terminology

Two key concepts from SEMIC Terminology are:

== The Semantic data specification 

In the model2owl project we require a semantic data specification to support the https://www.toop.eu/[once-only principle] as defined by the https://semiceu.github.io/style-guide/1.0.0/terminological-clarifications.html#sec:what-is-a-semantic-data-specification[SEMIC definition]. 

This data specification is composed of 

* https://semiceu.github.io/style-guide/1.0.0/terminological-clarifications.html#sec:what-is-a-cv-specification[A core vocabulary (Lightweight ontology)]  

* https://semiceu.github.io/style-guide/1.0.0/terminological-clarifications.html#sec:what-is-a-data-shape-contraint[A Data-shape specification (SHACL)]

== The Conceptual model 

We describe our https://semiceu.github.io/style-guide/1.0.0/terminological-clarifications.html#sec:what-is-a-conceptual-model[Conceptual model] using UML, in the https://sparxsystems.com/[Enterprise Architect] software tool.
