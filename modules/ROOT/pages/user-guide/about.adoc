= Introduction

This user guide provides detailed documentation on **model2owl**, a toolset for transforming UML models into
various semantic artefacts, including OWL ontologies and SHACL shapes. Model2owl simplifies the transformation
process by automating the conversion of a UML (v2.5) model from its XMI (v2.5.1) serialisation into formal,
standards-compliant RDF-based representations.
