[[sec:general-conv]]

In this section, a number of general conventions of either _conventional_ or _technical_ nature are provided. The topic starts with some general conventions, and then a number of generic areas are covered: naming things, providing appropriate descriptions, and generic recommendations on technical aspects of encoding such information. In each topic, both conventional and technical conventions are covered, as relevant.

[[sec:general-model]]
=== General conventions of the UML Model

To reduce the complexity of both the UML models, and the conversion of those UML models into derived artefacts i.e., OWL ontologies and SHACL shapes, a minimum set of UML model components and UML elements and connectors, were identified that express most of the ontological statements needed in practice. For this minimum set of UML model components, a xref:transformation/uml2owl-transformation.adoc[well-defined set of transformation rules] was agreed to ensure that the generation of derived artefacts is deterministic (not random) and complete. Other UML components were ignored.


[[rule:gen-model-elements]]
|===
|{set:cellbgcolor: #a8c6f7}
 *Title:* Supported UML model elements

|{set:cellbgcolor: #f5f8fc}
*Identifier:* rule:gen-model-elements

|*Statement:*
The UML model shall contain only the following types of UML elements: Class, DataType, Enumeration, Object and Package.
|===

*Description:*

The model2owl tool deals with the conversion of the following UML elements only: Class, DataType, Enumeration, Object and Package. Other UML elements are ignored, and therefore should not be used.


[[rule:gen-model-connectors]]
|===
|{set:cellbgcolor: #a8c6f7}
 *Title:* Supported UML connectors

|{set:cellbgcolor: #f5f8fc}
*Identifier:* rule:gen-model-connectors

|*Statement:*
The UML model shall contain only the following types of UML Connectors: Association, Dependency, Generalization and Realization.
|===

*Description:*

The model2owl tool deals with the conversion of the following UML connectors only: Association, Dependency, Generalization and Realization. Other types of UML connectors will be ignored, and therefore should not be used.


[[rule:gen-element-visibility]]
|===
|{set:cellbgcolor: #a8c6f7}
 *Title:* UML model components should be public

|{set:cellbgcolor: #f5f8fc}
*Identifier:* rule:gen-element-visibility

|*Statement:*
All UML model elements and connectors must be declared with the visibility set to "Public".
|===

*Description:*
This convention also includes that the UML class attributes have their visibility (or "Scope") set to "Public", and that all named roles specified at either end of any of the connectors have their visibility (or "Access") set to "Public".


[[sec:names]]
=== Naming Conventions

Defining naming and structural conventions for concepts in an ontology, and strictly adhering to them, not only makes the ontology easier to understand, it also helps avoid common modelling mistakes.

UML is a language without formal semantics. Moreover, it is quite flexible and permissive in the ways in which a concept can be expressed. It also allows many alternatives in naming concepts. Often there is no particular reason to choose one alternative over another, however, https://protege.stanford.edu/publications/ontology_development/ontology101.pdf[defining a set of naming conventions for classes, relations, attributes, controlled lists and adhering to it is necessary].

In theory, any name can be assigned to a concept, relationship or property. In practice, however, there are two types of constraints on the kind of names that should be used: _technical_ and _conventional_. This section deals with recommendations for conventional names, and technical aspects such as [xref:sec:namespaces[]], [xref:sec:charset[]], and [xref:sec:stereotypes-tags[]] are covered in later sections.


[[rule:gen-names-labels-and-ids]]
|===
|{set:cellbgcolor: #a8c6f7}
 *Title:* Support for generation of human- and machine-readable denominations

|{set:cellbgcolor: #f5f8fc}
*Identifier:* rule:gen-names-labels-and-ids

|*Statement:*
Element names should support generation of human- and machine-readable denominations, and they shall follow the short URI notation: `prefix:localSegment` .

|===

*Description:*

The naming conventions apply to _element names_ in the conceptual model. These names are intended for further use as human-readable denominations, called _labels_; and machine-readable denominations, called _identifiers_. The identifiers serve as a https://doi.org/10.17487/RFC3986[basis for generating URIs] to ensure unambiguous reference to a formal construct; while the labels are meant to be understandable by human-readers. For this reason it is assumed that mostly the conventional recommendations provided here apply to them, and none of the technical constraints.

[[rule:gen-names-language]]
|===
|{set:cellbgcolor: #a8c6f7}
 *Title:* Recommendation on language

|{set:cellbgcolor: #f5f8fc}
*Identifier:* rule:gen-names-language

|*Statement:*
Element names shall be formulated using British English. Multilingual support, if needed, should be provided through additional labels.

|===
*Description:*

It is recommended by https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/sites/default/files/document/2017-08/d02.01_specification_of_the_process_and_methodology_v1.00.pdf[Dekkers et al, 2017], that the names and descriptions for classes and properties are expressed in British English, and also, that a mechanism for providing a multilingual labelling system should be adopted.


[[rule:gen-names-namespaces]]
|===
|{set:cellbgcolor: #a8c6f7}
 *Title:* Namespace definition

|{set:cellbgcolor: #f5f8fc}
*Identifier:* rule:gen-names-namespaces

|*Statement:*
All prefixes used in the element names must refer to a valid namespace declaration, including a default namespace.
|===
*Description:*

The names should also belong to and be organised by _namespaces_. They can be provided as a short prefix to the elements name, for example "org:Organization", "epo:Notice" or "skos:Concept". Namespaces are addressed in detail in Section [xref:uml/conv-general.adoc#sec:namespaces[Namespaces]].

[[rule:gen-clear-language]]
|===
|{set:cellbgcolor: #a8c6f7}
 *Title:* Use clear language

|{set:cellbgcolor: #f5f8fc}
*Identifier:* rule:gen-clear-language

|*Statement:*
Clear and plain language shall be used; and abbreviations, unpronounceable, easily confusable, cryptic, and other difficult terms shall be avoided in element names.
|===

*Description:*

It is recommended that abbreviations in concept names, and  the words employed in the metamodel such as "class", "property", "attribute", "connector" etc, are avoided. Names that are nonsensical, unpronounceable, hard to read, or easily confusable with other names also should not be employed https://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/[(Bray et al, 2008)].


// [[sec:casing]]
//=== Case sensitivity

[[rule:gen-names-case]]
|===
|{set:cellbgcolor: #a8c6f7}
 *Title:* Case sensitivity

|{set:cellbgcolor: #f5f8fc}
*Identifier:* rule:gen-names-case

|*Statement:*
Names are case-sensitive. Names of elements of the same type should use consistent capitalisation.
|===

*Description:*

The readability of an ontology can be greatly improved if consistent capitalisation is used for concept names. For example, it is common to capitalise class names and use lower case for property names. The names of classes, data-types and enumerations must begin with a capital letter while the names of class attributes, enumeration items, association and dependency relations, including their source and target roles, must begin with a lower case character.

All names are case-sensitive. This means that the class "Buyer" and the attribute "buyer" are two different names. Nonetheless, such similarities are strongly discouraged and more elaborated names are highly encouraged. For example, a simple elaboration is to use suffixes or prefixes.  See rules:

//TODO: add reference to rules about avoiding duplication and usage of suffix/prefix

[[sec:delimitation]]
//=== Delimitation

[[rule:gen-names-multi]]
|===
|{set:cellbgcolor: #a8c6f7}
 *Title:* Delimitation in multi-word names

|{set:cellbgcolor: #f5f8fc}
*Identifier:* rule:gen-names-multi

|*Statement:*
Names containing multiple words shall use _camelCase_ or _PascalCase_ as word delimiting mechanism.
|===

*Description:*

In UML, using spaces in names is allowed and using them may be the most intuitive solution for many ontology developers. It is however, important to consider other systems with which the system may interact. If those systems do not use spaces or if your presentation medium does not handle spaces well, it can be useful to use another method https://protege.stanford.edu/publications/ontology_development/ontology101.pdf[(Noy et al, 2001)].

It is recommended that using spaces in element names is avoided, and a camel-case convention is followed instead. _CamelCasing_ is the practice of writing phrases such that the word or abbreviation in the middle of the phrase begins with a capital case.

//[TODO: Check if the following is still holds]
If in an exception, the conceptual model authors are obliged to maintain high readability of the UML diagrams, spaces may be tolerated and handled by the conversion script. In the conversion process, spaces are trimmed and phrases turned into camel-case form. For example " Pre-award catalogue request " is transformed into "Pre-AwardCatalogueRequest".

[[sec:uniqueness]]
//=== Name uniqueness

[[rule:gen-names-unique]]
|===
|{set:cellbgcolor: #a8c6f7}
 *Title:* Name uniqueness and reuse

|{set:cellbgcolor: #f5f8fc}
*Identifier:* rule:gen-names-unique

|*Statement:*
Element names (Class, Datatype, Enumeration, Object, Package) must be unique, while the Attribute and Connector role names, with certain restrictions, can be reused.
|===

*Description:*

In the formal ontology, each class, property or individual must be uniquely identifiable by its identifier. Therefore, the elements of the conceptual model, classes, attributes, connectors, instance, should have unique names.

This means that a class and an attribute with the same name (such as a class "Buyer" and a property "Buyer") cannot co-exist. Neither can a class and an instance, or an instance and a relation, with the same name co-exist.

Names that reduce to the same identifier are considered the same. For example "Legal Entity" and "LegalEntity" are different labels, but they reduce to the same identifier "LegalEntity". In such cases the names are considered equal, and the UML elements replicated.

Although name uniqueness is a recommendation, sometimes it is useful to replicate a UML element. In such cases, when the names are reused, the assumption is that the two UML elements represent manifestations of the same meaning. This is especially important for relations, and is explained in the convention [xref:#rule:gen-relation-reuse[]].

The names of the following THINGS shall be unique against the OTHER THINGS (i.e. shall not be reused as names of the other things):

* elements (Class, DataType, Enumeration, Object, Package) -> elements, attributes, connector roles (dependency & association)
* attributes -> elements, connector roles (dependency & association)
* connector role (dependecy & association) -> elements, attributes
* dependency connector role  → association connector role
* association connector role → dependency connector role


//[[sec:relation-reusability]]
//=== Relations reusability

[[rule:gen-relation-reuse]]
|===
|{set:cellbgcolor: #a8c6f7}
 *Title:* Reuse of relations

|{set:cellbgcolor: #f5f8fc}
*Identifier:* rule:gen-relation-reuse

|*Statement:*
Connector and Attribute names shall be chosen such as to support the appropriate level of reuse.

|===

*Description:*

Relation names should be chosen so that there is a balance of accuracy and precision on one hand, and  relation reusability on the other hand. These two dimensions are inversely correlated: the higher the reuse the lower the accuracy and vice versa.

If we choose more generic predicates such as "isSpecifiedIn" this tends towards maximising relation reusability across the model. However, the risk of overloading the relation meaning also increases.

The above risk could be mitigated by simply appending the range class to the relation name: such as "isSpecifiedInContract" and "isSpecifiedInProcedure" following the following naming pattern. This ensures predicate uniqueness and maximum level of specificity at the cost of reusability across and beyond the model.

The latter can be achieved through inference, but an additional predicate inheritance structure must be defined. Another risk is that a change or evolution of the name of the class has a direct impact on all incoming predicates, thus raising the chances of errors. This in turn may decrease the model's agility and elasticity.

Optionally, the transformation process from the conceptual model to the formal ontology may contain a mechanism that appends the name of the range class to the predicate name to produce a predicate with higher specificity automatically, should that be required.


[[sec:suffix-prefix]]
//=== Suffix and prefix

[[rule:gen-names-suffix-prefix]]
|===
|{set:cellbgcolor: #a8c6f7}
 *Title:* Use of suffixes and prefixes

|{set:cellbgcolor: #f5f8fc}
*Identifier:* rule:gen-names-suffix-prefix

|*Statement:*
Attributes and connector names shall contain a verb. Apply certain, well establish, prefixes and/or suffixes, in a consistent fashion, to achieve this goal.
|===

*Description:*

Some ontology engineering methodologies suggest using prefix and suffix conventions in names to distinguish between classes and attributes. Two common practices are to add a "has-" prefix, or a "-of" suffix, to attribute names. The attributes then become "hasAwardStatus" and ”hasBuyer” if we chose the "has-" convention. The attributes become "awardStatusOf" and "buyerOf" if we chose the "-of" convention. This approach allows  immediate determination whether the term is a class or an attribute. However, https://protege.stanford.edu/publications/ontology_development/ontology101.pdf[term names become slightly longer].

The recommendation is that the names of class attributes employ the "has-" suffix. For boolean properties the use of the "is-" prefix is recommended.

Other common suffixes are the prepositions "-by" and "-to". https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-org/[The organisation ontology] exemplifies their usage in cases such as "embodiedBy" and "conformsTo". However, if the preposition can be avoided as per the https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/interoperable-europe/news/final-evaluation-isa2-has-been-adopted[ISA project]'s "https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/sites/default/files/document/2012-03/D3.1-Process%20and%20Methodology%20for%20Core%20Vocabularies_v1.01.pdf[Process and Methodology for Core Vocabularies]" document, then it is recommended to do so.

It is also recommended to use prepositions in the ontology terms only if necessary, where they make the meaning more clear.

There is the option to use common and descriptive prefixes and suffixes for related properties or classes. While they are just labels, and their names have no inherent semantic meaning, it is still a useful way for humans to cluster and understand the vocabulary. For example, https://www.researchgate.net/publication/319395252_Extensible_Markup_Language_XML_10_Fifth_Edition?_tp=eyJjb250ZXh0Ijp7ImZpcnN0UGFnZSI6Il9kaXJlY3QiLCJwYWdlIjoiX2RpcmVjdCJ9fQ[properties about languages or tools might contain suffixes such as "Language" (e.g. "displayLanguage") or "Tool" (e.g. "validationTool") for all related properties].

[[sec:descriptions]]
=== Notes, descriptions and comments

A large emphasis is set on the naming conventions, however, more often than not, a good name is insufficient for an accurate or easy comprehension by human-readers. To address this, and to increase the conceptual richness, practitioners may wish to provide human-readable definitions, notes, examples and comments clarifying the underlying assumptions,and providing usage examples, additional explanations and other types of information.

[[rule:gen-description]]
|===
|{set:cellbgcolor: #a8c6f7}
 *Title:* Description of elements

|{set:cellbgcolor: #f5f8fc}
*Identifier:* rule:gen-description

|*Statement:*
All elements must have a definition providing a concise but complete description of the concept.
|===

*Description:*

The https://github.com/SEMICeu/OpenGuidelines/blob/main/Principles%20for%20creating%20good%20definitions_v1.00.pdf[SEMIC Principles for creating good definitions] have been adopted. They are based on advice found in the literature and are the following:

* Be concise but complete,
** Avoid over-generalisations. Adapt and contextualise the definition to the surrounding/ connected concepts.
** Make sure that every concept that occurs in the model is directly (or indirectly) defined.
* Describe only one term.
* Structure the definition in a standardised way:
** Use the singular form to phrase the definition (see [xref:sec:names[]]).
** State what the term is, and don't enumerate what it is NOT (i.e. no negative definition).
** Use only commonly understood abbreviations.
** Use similar terminology for definitions of related concepts.
* Don't use  circular definitions, i.e. the term defined should not be part of the definition.
* Don't add secondary information such as additional explanation, scoping, examples, etc. these are to be documented in usage notes.
* Form the definition in one or more sentences that start with a capital letter and end with a period.
* Do not start a definition with a repetition of the name of the concept.
//* Rich standard encodings such as UTF-8 and UTF-16 are supported in notes and definitions. In the element names, however,
//we recommend avoiding any character encodings and using plain ASCII [xref:semicsg/references.adoc#ref:epo-cmc[epo-cmc, sec 4.2]].

In addition to the SEMIC recommendation for providing good definitions, the following recommendations for completing the description of an element have been added:

* It is recommended that each element is defined by a crisp, one-line definition. The definition starts with a capital letter and ends with a period.

* A description may provide complementary information concerning the usage of the element, or its relation to relevant standards. For example, a description may contain recommendations about which controlled vocabularies to use and describe the underlying assumptions and additional explanations for reducing ambiguity. Descriptions may contain multiple paragraphs separated by blank lines. The descriptions should not paraphrase the definitions.

* If the model editor provides concrete examples of possible element values or instances then they should be provided as a comma-separated list. Each example value is enclosed in quotes and is optionally followed by a short explanation enclosed in parentheses https://ec.europa.eu/isa2/sites/default/files/e-government_core_vocabularies_handbook.pdf[(eGovernment Core Vocabularies Handbook)].

*See also:* SEMIC Style Guide Rule [https://semiceu.github.io/style-guide/1.0.0/gc-general-conventions.html#sec:gc-r5[GC-R5]], which provides more recommendations to be followed here.

[[sec:controlled-lists]]
=== Controlled lists

A controlled list is a carefully selected list of words and phrases and commonly employed in modelling practices. The controlled list has a name, and a set of terms. For example, the list of grammatical genders can be named "Gender" and comprise the terms "masculine", "feminine", "neuter" and "utrum".

As a rule of thumb, the relationship between the controlled list as a whole, and the elements comprising it, can be informally conceptualised as a class-instance, class-subclass, set-item, or part-whole.

[[rule:gen-controlled-list]]
|===
|{set:cellbgcolor: #a8c6f7}
 *Title:* Representation of known controlled lists

|{set:cellbgcolor: #f5f8fc}
*Identifier:* rule:gen-controlled-list

|*Statement:*

When the controlled list is known, and it can be referred to by a short URI, then it
shall be represented as uml:Enumeration element.
|===

*Description:*

Controlled lists play an essential role in establishing interoperability standards. Management and publication of controlled lists should happen as a separate process, and are not addressed here. References to controlled lists shall be done via uml:Enumeration elements.

The expectation is that the controlled lists are published in accordance with best practices and represented with the SKOS model using persistent identifiers. In such an approach, the controlled list is expressed as a `skos:ConceptScheme` and the specific values as `skos:Concept`(s). Also, such controlled lists are often developed, published and maintained independently following their own lifecycle, so that they can be reused in other models.

Two use-cases can be identified in practice: (a) when the code list is known and is explicitly referred to as the range of a property, and (b) when a property is modelled but no code list reference is provided as its range.

[[rule:gen-controlled-list-unknown]]
|===
|{set:cellbgcolor: #a8c6f7}
 *Title:* Representation of unknown controlled lists

|{set:cellbgcolor: #f5f8fc}
*Identifier:* rule:gen-controlled-list-unknown

|*Statement:*

When the controlled list is unknown, then it shall not be referred to, but instead a class uml:Attribute shall be defined with datatype `skos:Concept` class.

|===

*Description:*

When the authors of a conceptual model intend to omit which controlled list shall be used, then a class attribute with the range `skos:Concept` (in some cases `Code` is preferred, but it is strongly recommended avoiding this) can be created to indicate that. This approach can be useful in situations when multiple (external) controlled lists could be used interchangeably. For example, the `adms:status` property of a `dcat:CatalogueRecord` shall be a `skos:Concept`, without specifying the controlled list.

[[rule:gen-controlled-list-empty]]
|===
|{set:cellbgcolor: #a8c6f7}
 *Title:* Controlled list values

|{set:cellbgcolor: #f5f8fc}
*Identifier:* rule:gen-controlled-list-empty

|*Statement:*

uml:Enumeration shall contain no values. Management of the controlled list of values shall be done outside the scope of the conceptual model.
|===
*Description:*

It is advisable, however, to be specific as to which controlled list is used. In such cases, an Enumeration shall be created representing the controlled list. The Enumeration shall be empty, i.e., not specifying any value, because the values are assumed to be maintained externally and only the reference is necessary.

The properties having this controlled list as range shall be depicted as UML dependency connectors between a Class and an Enumeration [xref:uml/conv-connectors.adoc#sec:dependency[uml:Dependency]]. For example, in ePO, `dct:Location` can have a country code represented as a dependency relation to `at-voc:country` (the country authority table published on the EU Vocabularies website).

image::cmc-r14-1.png[]

The name of the Enumeration shall be resolved to a URI identical to that of the `skos:ConceptScheme`. As for the connector type we recommend using a dependency connector (depicted with a dashed line) because the semantic interpretation differs slightly from the association connector (depicted with a continuous line). Namely, the range of the property has to fulfil two constraints: (a) instantiating the `skos:Concept` class and (b) being `skos:inScheme` the intended controlled list xref:architecture/ontology-architecture.adoc[(ePO Architecture)]
//TODO: this reference can be replaced with a cross-reference to the architecture section of this Model2OWL documentation, when that part will be updated.



// If the controlled list is specific to the model then the author shall define the values of the UML Enumeration inside of it, which are interpreted as concepts belonging to the containing concept scheme [xref:references.adoc#ref:oslo-rules[oslo-rules, sec 3.2.17]].
// [TODO: check if this is also the case for EPO, and if the reference is appropriate] [TODO: See if it makes sense to insert here the statement from above: "It is required that the controlled lists are named using nouns or nominal phrases starting with a capital letter. The enumeration items must start with a lower case."]

More specific requirements on the uml:Enumeration elements are provided in the Section [xref:uml/conv-enumerations.adoc#sec:enumeration[uml:Enumeration]].

[[sec:technical]]
//== Technical constraints


[[sec:namespaces]]
=== Namespaces

In order to enable the reuse of names defined in other models and reuse of unique references for names that support easy identification, namespace management must be considered. We adopt an XML approach in defining and managing namespaces as it is inherent in both XMI and OWL2 standards. Hence, a _namespace_ is a set of symbols that is used to organise objects of various kinds, so that these objects may be referred to by name and are uniquely identifiable.

// Namespaces are commonly structured as hierarchies to allow reuse of names in different contexts [xref:references.adoc#ref:xml-namespaces[xml-namespaces]]. This mechanism can be implemented in UML through partitioning the model using packages, which are described in the [xref:uml/conv-packages.adoc#sec:uml-package[uml:Package]] Section.

[[rule:gen-namespaces-declared]]
|===
|{set:cellbgcolor: #a8c6f7}
 *Title:* Known namespaces

|{set:cellbgcolor: #f5f8fc}
*Identifier:* rule:gen-namespaces-declared

|*Statement:*

Namespaces must be defined before used in the model. All prefixes shall be assigned a base URI.

|===
*Description:*

A namespace organises a collection of names obeying three constraints: each name is (1) unique, (2) assigned consistently, and (3) assigned according to a common https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.17487/RFC8141[definition] [namespace]. An (expanded) _name_ in a namespace is a pair consisting of a _namespace name_, also called _base URI_ or just _base_, and a _local name_, also called _local segment_ https://www.researchgate.net/publication/319395252_Extensible_Markup_Language_XML_10_Fifth_Edition?_tp=eyJjb250ZXh0Ijp7ImZpcnN0UGFnZSI6Il9kaXJlY3QiLCJwYWdlIjoiX2RpcmVjdCJ9fQ[(Bray et al 2008] & https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc2141/[Moats, 2023)]. The combination of universally managed URIs with the vocabulary local name is effective in avoiding name clashes. For example, in the expanded name

`http://www.w3.org/ns/org#Organization`, `http://www.w3.org/ns/org#`

is the namespace name and `Organization` is the local name.

// URI references are often inconveniently long, so expanded names should not be used directly. Instead, _qualified names_ should be used while expanded names are strongly discouraged. A _qualified name_ is a name subject to namespace interpretation. Syntactically, they are either _prefixed names_ or _unprefixed names_.
//
// ```
// qualifiedName = [<namespacePrefix>:]<localName>
// ```
//
// The namespace name is usually applied as a _prefix_ to the local name, but it may be missing as well. [xref:references.adoc#ref:xml-namespaces[xml-namespaces]] specifies a declaration syntax which permits the binding of prefixes to namespace names and also to bind a default namespace that applies to unprefixed element names. For example, we can bind the namespace name "http://www.w3.org/ns/org#" to the prefix "org", which we can then use to create the same name as such "org:Organization". The prefix is subject to namespace interpretation and resolved to an URI [xref:references.adoc#ref:xml-namespaces[xml-namespaces]].
//
// If the delimiter (:) is used without any prefix, then the empty string prefix is resolved to the default namespace as defined in [xref:references.adoc#ref:xml-namespaces[xml-namespaces]].

[[sec:charset]]
=== Character encoding

In the formal ontology, the URIs must conform to https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-mt/[RDF 1.1] and https://www.w3.org/TR/xml/[XML] format specifications. Both languages effectively require that terms begin with an upper or lower case letter from the ASCII character set, or an underscore (_). This tight restriction means that, for example, terms may not begin with a number, hyphen or accented character https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/sites/default/files/document/2012-03/D3.1-Process%20and%20Methodology%20for%20Core%20Vocabularies_v1.01.pdf[(Process and Methodology used for Core Vocabularies)]. Although underscores are permitted, they are discouraged as they may be, in some cases, misread as spaces. A formal definition of these restrictions is given in the XML specification document https://www.researchgate.net/publication/319395252_Extensible_Markup_Language_XML_10_Fifth_Edition?_tp=eyJjb250ZXh0Ijp7ImZpcnN0UGFnZSI6Il9kaXJlY3QiLCJwYWdlIjoiX2RpcmVjdCJ9fQ[(Bray et al, 2008)].

*Description:*

Encoded UTF-8 and UTF-16 names may be used https://www.researchgate.net/publication/319395252_Extensible_Markup_Language_XML_10_Fifth_Edition?_tp=eyJjb250ZXh0Ijp7ImZpcnN0UGFnZSI6Il9kaXJlY3QiLCJwYWdlIjoiX2RpcmVjdCJ9fQ[(Bray et al, 2008], https://www.w3.org/TR/2014/PR-rdf11-concepts-20140109/diff-20131105.html[Bickly & Guha, 2014)] but we recommend avoiding any character encodings in the element names. Encoded characters are mostly not readable and require a decoding to become human friendly. Also, unexpected results may occur when running the transformation script. This recommendation does not apply to content strings such as descriptions, notes and comments, which may use any encoding character.

|{set:cellbgcolor: #a8c6f7}
 *Title:* Stereotypes

|{set:cellbgcolor: #f5f8fc}
*Identifier:* rule:gen-stereotypes

|*Statement:*
Stereotypes have no semantics and hence shall be avoided. Exceptionally, some selected, agreed-upon stereotypes may be used.
|===

*Description:*

The use of stereotypes is not recommended. There should be only a small set of stereotypes, with well-defined meaning and pre-established transformation rules that shall be used in the conceptual model. In this set of rules the `\<<Abstract>>` stereotype is adopted to mark abstract classes [xref:uml/conv-classes.adoc#rule:class-abstract[see convention on Abstract Classes]].

 *Title:* Tags

|{set:cellbgcolor: #f5f8fc}
*Identifier:* rule:gen-tags

|*Statement:*
UML tags shall be used to provide additional descriptions of the element in a consistent and structure manner.
|===

*Description:*

When providing additional information to an element (classes, enumerations, datatypes, connectors, attributes, connector roles) through a tag ensure that:

* The tag name is provided and should be either a short URI or short URI with a language tag (e.g. @en).
* There is a value associated to each tag that appears on an element.

*Note:* Tags should not be used as the sole (or primary) source of concept identifier generation, i.e. every UML element that has tags attached, should, in the first place, have a proper name provided according to the conventions in the [xref:sec:names[]] section.
