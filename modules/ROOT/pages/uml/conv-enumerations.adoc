===  Technical conventions on uml:Enumeration elements

In UML the controlled lists, discussed in Section [xref:uml/conv-general.adoc#sec:controlled-lists[Controlled List]] are represented as uml:Enumeration. They are transformed into instances of a SKOS model [xref:references.adoc#ref:skos-spec[skos-spec]].

 *Title:* Interpretation of uml:Enumeration

|{set:cellbgcolor: #f5f8fc}
*Identifier:* rule:enumeration-to-skos

|*Statement:*

An uml:Enumeration element is transformed into `skos:ConceptScheme`, and an enumeration item into a `skos:Concept`.
|===

*Description:*


Each uml:Enumeration element is transformed into skos:ConceptScheme, and each enumeration item, if present as an uml:Attribute value, is transformed into a `skos:Concept`. An enumeration might be empty, especially when they refer to externally specified controlled lists.

//TODO We need in fact a flag that controlled whether the Enum definitions shall be present in the core layer (at all), or not.

In a uml:Enumeration element, the name shall be interpreted as the controlled list name; it must be a normalised string. Each attribute name is used as a local segment in the generation of the concept URI. The attribute type is ignored and by default is considered to be `skos:Concept`. The attribute alias is transformed into the `skos:Concept`s preferred label. The attribute initial value is transformed into the alternative label of the concept.
//TODO see if we need to specify additional rules for this.

In case no attribute alias is specified then the attribute name is used as preferred label of the skos:Concept. This happens as skos:prefLabel is a mandatory property in the SKOS model.

It is possible to employ the enumerations for class properties by drawing a dependency (uml:Dependency) relation from the class to the enumeration and provide a relation target role. However, the enumeration should not connect to other elements.

 *Title:* uml:Enumeration constraint level

*Identifier:* rule:enumeration-constraint-level

|*Statement:*
An uml:Enumeration items are restricted according to one of two constraint levels set for their uml:Enumeration element.

*Description:*

Formal specification of a controlled list is important for enabling validation of data described with the model. Particularly, this is required for the purpose of validating values of properties expecting a controlled list values (as described in xref:../transformation/transf-rules2.adoc#rule:dependency-uni-range-ds[rule:dependency-uni-range-ds]). 

However, providing such a formal specification (incorporated into the conceptual model as described in xref:./conv-general.adoc#rule:incorporation-of-controlled-list[rule:incorporation-of-controlled-list]) for validation purposes is not always possible or desirable. For example, a SKOS specification of the controlled list may not exist. Therefore, SHACL shapes for corresponding enumerations, that implements constraints for validation purposes, accomodate for both _referencing_ and _defining_ usage cases. 
It is done by introducing a concept of a _constraint level_ that is used to specify restrictiveness of a NodeShape for an enumeration. Every UML Enumeration element is expected to specify the constraint level. There are two constraint levels that are suitable for the use cases:

1. `permissive`: Suitable when a controlled list specification is not available. Causes generation of a permissive shape for items of the corresponding enumeration. The generated constraint makes no assumptions about the corresponding controlled list and sets `skos:Concept` as the expected type for an item.
2. `restrictive`: Suitable when a controlled list specification is available. Causes generation of a restrictive shape for items of the corresponding enumeration. The generated constraints assume that an item belongs to a concept scheme (`skos:ConceptScheme`) identified by the URI used as the name of the corresponding UML Enumeration element.

Every UML Enumeration element have to specify the constraint level as a tag, using a datatype property of choice for that purpose (set in configuration). The following example use a hypothetical `ex:constraintLevel` property to set _restrictive_ level for `at-voc:applicability` enumeration.

Details on how to configure model2owl can be found in the link:../user-guide/configuration-file.html#controlled-vocabulary-parameters[User Guide section].

A tag with the specified key is not materialized in model2owl artefacts. It is used only to control what SHACL shapes should be generated.
