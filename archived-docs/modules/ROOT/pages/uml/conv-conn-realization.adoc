[[rule:realization-btw-object-and-class-or-enum]]
|===
|{set:cellbgcolor: #a8c6f7}
 *Title:* uml:Realization connects objects with classes or enumerations

|{set:cellbgcolor: #f5f8fc}
*Identifier:* rule:realization-btw-object-and-class-or-enum

|*Statement:*
uml:Realization connectors connect a uml:Object element to a uml:Class or uml:Enumeration element.
|===

*Description:*

The uml:Realization connector signifies an instantiation relation, and is transformed into a `rdf:type` relation standing between the source object and the target class. Where the target is a uml:Enumeration element (and the enum is converted into a `skos:ConceptScheme` instance, and the object into a `skos:Concept`), then the relation should be translated into a `skos:inScheme` relation.

//[TODO:] Check if the last sentence is correct. Also, wouldn't it be more appropriate if we would use a "composition", or at least "aggregation", relation to connect object to enums?


[[rule:realization-name]]
|===
|{set:cellbgcolor: #a8c6f7}
 *Title:* uml:Realization connector with no name

|{set:cellbgcolor: #f5f8fc}
*Identifier:* rule:realization-name

|*Statement:*
uml:Realization connectors shall have no name or a target role specified.
|===

*Description:*

The uml:Realization connectors must have no name (see the xref:uml/conv-connectors.adoc#rule:connectors-name[General convention on connector names]) nor source/target roles specified in the UML model.


[[rule:realization-multiplicity]]
|===
|{set:cellbgcolor: #a8c6f7}
 *Title:* uml:Realization connector with no multiplicity

|{set:cellbgcolor: #f5f8fc}
*Identifier:* rule:realization-multiplicity

|*Statement:*
uml:Realization connectors shall have no target or source multiplicity specified.
|===

*Description:*

The multiplicity must not be specified at the target nor at the source end of the uml:Realization connector.


[[rule:realization-proxy-objects]]
|===
|{set:cellbgcolor: #a8c6f7}
 *Title:* Proxy objects

|{set:cellbgcolor: #f5f8fc}
*Identifier:* rule:realization-proxy-objects

|*Statement:*
For objects defined in external models proxy uml:Object elements should be defined.
|===

*Description:*

Where an object used in this model is defined in an external model as a proxy, a uml:Object element should be created so that it can be connected to classes in the model. For example, if we want to refer to the `time:unitMonth` instance of the class `time:TemporalUnit`, then a proxy for `time:unitMonth` individual (and in this case also of the class `time:TemporalUnit`) must be created (ideally in a dedicated `time` package).
